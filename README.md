## What is ReactOS Longhorn?

ReactOS Longhorn is a place for people interested in seeing ReactOS pursue higher compatibility test and implement features they want to see.

It's a repo to hold it all together that acts as a testing ground for features with all NT6+ features.

If you want to implement a Vista+ feature into ReactOS this is a good place to test your work and see it interact with a vista+ situation,

This project is not affiliated by the offical ReactOS project

### Product quality warning

**ReactOS is currently an Alpha quality operating system.** This means that ReactOS is under heavy development and you have to be ready to encounter some problems. Different things may not work well and it can corrupt the data present on your hard disk. It is HIGHLY recommended to test ReactOS on a virtual machine or on a computer with no sensitive or critical data!
